This is my assignment 2 for the Unix & C Programming unit of Year 2 Semester 1.

In short, it's an extended version of Assignment 1's CLI ASCII-based game coded in C89. A game where the player needs to go from their spawn point to a distant goal in the map while dodging obstacles. Of which the map can be easily drawn up by the user on a .txt file.

Full details and specifications can be found in the Assigment_Specifications.pdf file.
